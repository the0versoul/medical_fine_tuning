    "# Fine-Tuning an LLM: Medical Test Performance (Before and After)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed as a starter kit to fine-tuning. Fine-tuning has a ton of useful applications, from changing the tone of the LLM, incorporating a specific vernacular or body of language into the LLM, or having the LLM \"specialize\" in a certain area. Therefore this is an important area of understanding for fully leveraging LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be trying to get the LLM to pass a medical entrance exam as an example. See the description: \n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA is a large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions._\n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA has more than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which require a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study._\n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA provides an open-source dataset for the Natural Language Processing community. It is expected that this dataset would facilitate future research toward achieving better QA systems. The dataset contains questions about the following topics:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/medmcqa\n",
    "- Papers with Code link: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/medmcqa\n",
    "- Dataset on Github for Download: https://github.com/MedMCQA/MedMCQA\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be using GPT3.5 for this purpose in order to keep things simple for now (no custom LLMs). OpenAI makes this process relatively straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The harder part, however, is assessing performance. OpenAI does provide some stuff like token accuracy to do this, but it isn't perfect - it doesn't tell us if the LLM really \"accurately\" answered the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process we're going to use to do this is a bit convulted, and not perfect, but it should work relatively well. After all, this is a multiple-choice exam, so it should be easy for an LLM to see if another LLM made the right choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we are going to do is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Spit the data into training and testing sets \n",
    "- We are going to fine-tune the LLM on the training set to create two endpoints, one fine-tuned \"expert\" on the training set and one standard\n",
    "- Run the standard LLM on the test set and get the responses\n",
    "- Since the fine-tuned LLM is an \"expert\" (or should be), we will use it as a \"Grader\" to grade answers as correct (True) or incorrect (False) using OpenAI functions to properly format the output as well. Remember, it's a multiple choice test, so this shouldn't be hard for the LLM to determine. \n",
    "- We will then grade the LLM and give it a score \n",
    "- Finally, we will run the fine-tuned LLM on the test-set\n",
    "- We will have the LLM again grade itself using OpenAI functions to structure responses\n",
    "- We will grade the fine-tuned LLM and give it a score\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this is not perfect! We're having an LLM grade itself which is inherently flawed, but it is a multiple choice test, so it shouldn't be too hard for the LLM to determine if the LLM chose a, b, c, or d correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll give each LLM a \"letter grade\" based on its accuracy, like a B+ or an A for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the LLM boosts its grade by \"studying\"!"
