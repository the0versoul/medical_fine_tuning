    "# Fine-Tuning an LLM: Medical Test Performance (Before and After)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed as a starter kit to fine-tuning. Fine-tuning has a ton of useful applications, from changing the tone of the LLM, incorporating a specific vernacular or body of language into the LLM, or having the LLM \"specialize\" in a certain area. Therefore this is an important area of understanding for fully leveraging LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be trying to get the LLM to pass a medical entrance exam as an example. See the description: \n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA is a large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions._\n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA has more than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which require a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study._\n",
    "\n",
    "_MedMCQA provides an open-source dataset for the Natural Language Processing community. It is expected that this dataset would facilitate future research toward achieving better QA systems. The dataset contains questions about the following topics:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/medmcqa\n",
    "- Papers with Code link: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/medmcqa\n",
    "- Dataset on Github for Download: https://github.com/MedMCQA/MedMCQA\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be using GPT3.5 for this purpose in order to keep things simple for now (no custom LLMs). OpenAI makes this process relatively straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The harder part, however, is assessing performance. OpenAI does provide some stuff like token accuracy to do this, but it isn't perfect - it doesn't tell us if the LLM really \"accurately\" answered the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process we're going to use to do this is a bit convulted, and not perfect, but it should work relatively well. After all, this is a multiple-choice exam, so it should be easy for an LLM to see if another LLM made the right choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we are going to do is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Spit the data into training and testing sets \n",
    "- We are going to fine-tune the LLM on the training set to create two endpoints, one fine-tuned \"expert\" on the training set and one standard\n",
    "- Run the standard LLM on the test set and get the responses\n",
    "- Since the fine-tuned LLM is an \"expert\" (or should be), we will use it as a \"Grader\" to grade answers as correct (True) or incorrect (False) using OpenAI functions to properly format the output as well. Remember, it's a multiple choice test, so this shouldn't be hard for the LLM to determine. \n",
    "- We will then grade the LLM and give it a score \n",
    "- Finally, we will run the fine-tuned LLM on the test-set\n",
    "- We will have the LLM again grade itself using OpenAI functions to structure responses\n",
    "- We will grade the fine-tuned LLM and give it a score\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this is not perfect! We're having an LLM grade itself which is inherently flawed, but it is a multiple choice test, so it shouldn't be too hard for the LLM to determine if the LLM chose a, b, c, or d correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll give each LLM a \"letter grade\" based on its accuracy, like a B+ or an A for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the LLM boosts its grade by \"studying\"!"

For S. aureus NVE in patients who do not inject drugs, survival rates are 55-70%, whereas 85-90% of injection drug users survive this infection. PVE beginning within 2 months of valve rep/acemenf results in mortality rates of 40-50%, whereas rates are only 10-20% in later-onset cases.\"INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITISEtiology* Native valve endocarditis (NVE):o Community acquired: Streptococcus {S. viridans; S. gallolyticus; other non-group A, groupable streptococci and Abiotrophia spp).o Health care associated: Staphylococcus aureus.Endocarditis in IV drug abusers:o Right sided. Staphylococcus aureus.o Left sided: Enterococci and Staphylococcus aureusEarly prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE): Coagulase negative Staphylococci.Late prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE): Streptococcus viridians.Subacute endocarditis: Streptococcus viridians.Clinical FeaturesFever, chills and sweatsAnorexia, weight loss, malaiseMyalgias, arthralgiasNew/worsened regurgitant murmurArterial emboliSplenomegalyClubbingNeurologic manifestationsPeripheral manifestations {Osier's nodes, subungual hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Roth's spots)Petechiae.Laboratory ManifestationsAnemiaLeukocytosisMicroscopic hematuriaElevated erythrocyte sedimentation rateElevated C-reactive protein levelRheumatoid factorCirculating immune complexesDecreased serum complementImportant Points:Strep viridans endocarditis causes subacute endocarditis.Survival for patients with NVE with Strep viridans is 85-90%.S. aureus with IV drug abuse survival rate is 85-90%.PVE mortality is 40-50% early onset and 10% in late onset cases.Subacute endocarditis follows indolent course slow cardiac damage, rarely metastasizes, complicated by embolic event or mycotic aneurysm.Acute endocarditis causes hectic fever, rapid cardiac damage, hematogenous spread to extracardiac sites and death if untreated.S. aureus endocarditis causes:o Vegetations >10 mm.o Increased risk of embolisation,o Microabscesses in Brain and Meninges.Mycotic aneurysms, microabscesses in brain, glomerulonephritis can occur.Cardiac failure, perivalvular abscess, pericarditis, conduction blocks.The Duke Criteria for the Clinical Diagnosis of Infective EndocarditisMajor Criteria1. Positive blood cultureA). Typical microorganism for infective endocarditis from two separate blood cultures.Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus, HACEK group, Staphybcoccus aureus, orCommunity-acquired enterococci in the absence of a primary focus, orB). Persistently positive blood culture, defined as recovery of a microorganism consistent with infective endocarditis from:*. Blood cultures drawn >12 h apart; or*. All of 3 or a majority of >4 separate blood cultures, with first and last drawn at least 1 h apart.C). Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnedi or phase I IgG antibody titer of >1:800.2. Evidence of Endocardial InvolvementA) Positive echocardiogram*. Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures or in the path of regurgitant jets or in implanted material, in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation, or*. Abscess, or*. New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve.B) New valvular regurgitation {increase or change in preexisting murmur not sufficient).Minor Criteria1. Predisposition. Predisposing heart condition or injection drug use.2. Fever >38.0degC (>100.4degF).3. Vascular phenomena. Major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, Janeway lesions.4. Immunologic phenomena: Glomerulonephritis, Osier's nodes, Roth's spots, rheumatoid factor.5.
